# innovation_lab_binex

## Plan

Create a number (3) of binary exploitation challenges with a scoreboard to act as a CTF-like
binary exploitation and reverse engineering lane for the innovation lab. Current ideas for challenges
are:

- basic buffer overflow
- return to get_flag()
- basic shellcoding
